GUIDeFATE::JustWin32

=head1 Description

The Original GUIDeFATE was meant to be a "Quick and Dirty",  platform agmostic GUI bulder taking advantage of whatever back end was available on the system.  As a tool that served many potential libraries, installation was frequently difficult, and some of the dependencies were themselves difficult to install.  This uses a subset of GUIDeFATE to be an easy to install utility to help GUI app.
